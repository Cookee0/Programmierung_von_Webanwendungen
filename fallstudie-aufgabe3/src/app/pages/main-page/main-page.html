      <h2 id="1">What this page does</h2>

      <p>
        This page gives you a clear, honest view of the companies that produced the most CO₂ over the last five years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The table aggregates their reported emissions and lets you sort, search, and filter by year, company, and
        country so you can quickly spot patterns and outliers.
      </p>

      <p>It is designed for both quick scans and deeper dives:
        sort to see who leads the rankings, filter to compare peers, and explore details to understand context. <strong>Our
          goal is transparency.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        By putting comparable numbers in one place, we make it easier for citizens, students,
        investors, and professionals to discuss emissions with a shared set of facts and make better choices.
      </p>

      <h2 id="2">Why protecting the environment matters to you</h2>

      <p>
        Climate impacts are not distant or abstract—they shape daily life and pocketbooks. Rising temperatures and
        extreme weather disrupt supply chains, increase food and energy costs, and damage homes and infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Air pollution from fossil fuels harms health, especially for children and older adults, and leads to missed
        school and work. Regulations, carbon pricing, and technology shifts also affect jobs, savings, and local
        businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding which companies drive emissions helps you anticipate these risks, ask informed questions, and
        align purchases, career decisions, and investments with your values.</p>

      <p>
        Cleaner choices often mean <strong>healthier communities, more resilient economies, and long-term savings from
        efficiency and innovation.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2 id="3">What you can do to make a difference</h2>

      <p>
        Use the table to identify leaders and laggards, then act where you have influence.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a consumer, favor products and services from companies that cut emissions and disclose credible plans; reduce
        waste, choose efficient devices, and shift to low-carbon transport where possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a professional, bring emissions data into purchasing, vendor selection, and project planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a citizen or investor, engage companies: ask for targets, timelines, and verified progress—not just
        promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Share this page with colleagues or friends to spark constructive conversations.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Small, consistent steps add up, and your choices signal demand for cleaner energy, smarter design, and
        responsible leadership across entire industries.
      </p>
